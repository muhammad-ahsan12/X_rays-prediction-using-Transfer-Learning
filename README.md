# X-ray Prediction using Transfer Learning
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (X rays prediction using transfer learning.ipynb) that demonstrates the process of building a deep learning model for X-ray image classification using transfer learning with MobileNetV2 and VGG16 architectures. The model predicts whether an X-ray image shows signs of pneumonia or is normal.

# Notebook Overview
# Data Collection: 
The notebook downloads and extracts the Chest X-ray dataset from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.
# Data Preprocessing: 
The dataset is preprocessed using image augmentation techniques and divided into training, validation, and test sets.
# Model Building: 
Two transfer learning models, MobileNetV2 and VGG16, are used as base models. The fully connected layers are added on top of these models for binary classification.
# Model Training: 
The models are trained on the training data and evaluated on the validation data.
# Model Evaluation: 
The notebook includes evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to assess the model's performance.
# Model Prediction: 
The trained model is used to predict new X-ray images and display the predictions.
# Files Included
X rays prediction using transfer learning.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the entire workflow.
kaggle.json: Kaggle API token required for dataset download (not included in this repository).
TL_X_rays_model.h5: Saved TensorFlow/Keras model file.
